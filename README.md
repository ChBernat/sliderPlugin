# sliderPlugin
A slider that has been written in pure ES5.<br>

First, you have to install node.js, npm, grunt and bower.</solid><br>
<ul>
  <li><a href='https://nodejs.org/en/download/'>Node.js</a></li>
  <li>Update npm with this command: [sudo] <code>npm install npm -g</code> (sudo is optional AND you don't use it on Windows!)</li>
  <li>[*OPTIONAL] Install <a href='http://gruntjs.com/'>Grunt</a> with this command: <code>npm install -g grunt-cli</code></li>
  <li>Install <a href='http://bower.io/'>bower</a> with this command: <code>npm install -g bower</code></li>
</ul>
Now, when you have everything installed in a proper way you can install dependencies for this slider!<br>
To do this just follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the folder using <code>cd</code> command, which is available both for Windows and for Linux.</li>
<li>Launch these commands: <code>npm install</code>, <code>bower install</code> to install all dependencies.
</ul>
<br>
That's it! NPM and bower will install everything this slider needs to work! Isn't that beautiful?


*It's an optional step for developers. It will give you possibility to launch <code>watch</code> task for any .scss files change. Just navigate to root folder and launch <code>grunt</code> and it will be watching for these changes! Yes! That's as simple as that.
<br><br><br>
Slide animations are a future plan!
